## Coverage Summary by Category

### ✅ Fully Tested (100% coverage)
1. AudioChunk
2. PiperConfig
3. PiperException
4. PiperLogger

### ⚠️ Well Tested (>90% coverage)
1. CacheStatistics (95%)
2. PiperVoiceConfig (95%)

### ❌ Partially Tested (<50% coverage)
1. PiperTTS (40%) - Core async functionality not tested

### 📝 Not Applicable
1. IPiperTTS - Interface tested through implementation

---

## Critical Gaps in Test Coverage

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **PiperTTS.InitializeAsync()** - Critical initialization logic
2. **PiperTTS.GenerateAudio()** - Main TTS functionality
3. **PiperTTS.GenerateAudioAsync()** - Async TTS functionality
4. **PiperTTS.StreamAudioAsync()** - Streaming functionality
5. **PiperTTS.LoadVoiceAsync()** - Voice loading logic

### Medium Priority (Supporting Features)
1. **PiperTTS.SetCurrentVoice()** - Success paths
2. **PiperTTS.GetVoiceConfig()** - Success paths
3. **PiperTTS.PreloadTextAsync()** - Cache preloading
4. **CacheStatistics.LogStatistics()** - Logging output

### Low Priority (Minor Gaps)
1. **PiperVoiceConfig.SpeakingStyle** - Enum values
2. Integration tests between components

---

## Recommendations

1. **Create Async Test Framework**: Set up proper async testing infrastructure for Unity to test all async methods in PiperTTS.

2. **Mock Dependencies**: Create mock implementations for Unity Inference Engine components to enable testing without actual models.

3. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that verify the interaction between multiple components (e.g., PiperTTS with PiperVoiceConfig).

4. **Performance Tests**: Add benchmarks for critical paths like audio generation and caching.

5. **Error Scenario Tests**: Expand testing of error conditions and edge cases in PiperTTS.

---

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Excellent validation testing in PiperConfig
- Comprehensive exception testing
- Good edge case coverage for utility classes
- Proper disposal and cleanup testing

### Areas for Improvement
- Async method testing infrastructure needed
- Mock framework for external dependencies
- More integration testing
- Performance and stress testing
